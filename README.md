Tutorial on how to get nodejs up and running with mysql and docker-compose.

* Go to [docker-compose-start](https://github.com/lucassha/youtube-containers-tutorial/tree/docker-compose-start) to start the tutorial

* Go to [docker-compose-final](add link) to see the finished product. Many files are not relevant for the tutorial and probably poorly coded ;)
